 * \class Multijet
 * \brief Implements computation of the deviation of data from expectation in the multijet analysis
 * 
 * The deviation is computed as a chi^2 distance,
 *   chi^2 = sum_i (B^{Data}_i - B^{Sim}_i)^2 / (sigma^{Data}_i^2 + sigma^{Sim}_i^2),
 * where B_i is the mean balance observable in bin i in pt of the leading jet and sigma_i is its
 * statistical uncertainty. In data the mean balance observable is recomputed for the given jet
 * correction following the method described in [1-2].
